This game is being developed for the http://www.icsscsummerofcode.com/ competition and is loosely based on Advance Wars.

I don't have much more to say right now because I really don't know what the final product will look/feel like.

== TODO LIST ==
* Differentiate cells by the type of land/water it represents
* Provide a way to load arbitrary maps
* Definitely need some royalty-free sprites soon (soldier, tank, planes)
* Resize cells/sprites on the fly when the window/frame changes sizes
* Optimize the way cells light up on hover over
* Maybe make the map bigger than the screen and provide "panning" the view
* Lastly, add a cool intro menu and awesome music
