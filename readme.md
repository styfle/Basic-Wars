Basic Wars
==========

About
------
This game is being developed for the http://www.icsscsummerofcode.com/ competition and is loosely based on Advance Wars.

I don't have much more to say right now because I really don't know what the final product will look/feel like.

Todo List
---------
* Provide a way to load arbitrary maps
* Definitely need some royalty-free sprites soon (soldier, tank, planes)
* Resize cells/sprites on the fly when the window/frame changes sizes
* Optimize the way cells light up on hover over
* Maybe make the map bigger than the screen and provide "panning" the view
* Lastly, add a cool intro menu and awesome music

Completed
----------
* Differentiate cells by the type of land/water it represents


Beta Testing
------------
If you would like to try out Basic Wars, you can download the source and then compile the java source with the command: 
    javac *.java
Then execute the code with the command:
    java BasicWars
