Basic Wars
==========

About
-----
This game is being developed for the http://www.icsscsummerofcode.com/ competition and is loosely based on Advance Wars.

I don't have much more to say right now because I really don't know what the final product will look/feel like.

Todo List
---------
* Definitely need some royalty-free sprites soon (soldier, tank, planes)
* Resize cells/sprites on the fly when the window/frame changes sizes
* Optimize the way cells light up on hover over
* Maybe make the map bigger than the screen and provide "panning" the view
* Lastly, add a cool intro menu and awesome music

Completed
----------
* Differentiate cells by the type of land/water it represents
* Provide a way to load arbitrary maps


Beta Testing
------------
If you would like to try out Basic Wars, you need the to first install the JDK so you can comiple the source code. To compile, first navigate to the source folder and run this command: 

    javac *.java

Then execute the code with the command:

    java BasicWars
